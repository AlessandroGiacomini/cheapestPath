# Project: Cheapest path - Alessandro Giacomini
-----------------------------------

## Description
-----------------------------------

### Live [here](http://cheapest-path.appspot.com/)

The program finds the cheapest path from one vertex to another in a directed acyclic graph, given data in the format (starting vertex, ending vertex, cost). We assume all costs positive.

Using the data:
- A => B: 1
- B => C: 1
- A => C: 2.5
- A => D: 0.4
- D => B: 0.3

### Sample input
+ Starting Vertex: A
+ Ending Vertex: B

### Sample output
+ Path: A=>D=>B=>C
+ Cost: 1.7

# Functions and features
----------------------
+ The project is meant to work with directed acyclic graphs as input
+ Has been managed the case in which the user provides a null inputs for vertices or a vertex that doesn't belong to the graph
+ Responsive Design
